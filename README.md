# Touristivity
This is the web application made especially for those who are fond of travelling. It uses react hooks, store, firebase backend rest api relational data base, etc for optimization 
and seamless experience. It also makes use of the react router to route between the pages from the "react-router-dom" library and it also uses a single store imported 
from @reduxjs/toolkit which helps in efficient managment of component-wide and app-wide states.
